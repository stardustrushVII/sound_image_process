## Week 10 â€“ Particle Systems

### Description
This sketch implements a cosmic explosion particle system. Clicking the mouse triggers bursts of particles that simulate a starburst in space. Each particle has position, velocity, acceleration (wind), and a fade-out lifecycle. Trails are created using transparent background redraws.
